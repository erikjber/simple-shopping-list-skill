A skill for Mycroft. Adds items to the shopping list.

## About
There is only one list, and items can be added or deleted. there is a command to remove the last item.
Since Mycroft has been discontinued this skill is probably not very useful. It might or might not work with OpenVoiceOS, but that has not been tested and will not be supported.

## Examples
* "Add milk to my shopping list"
* "Add bread to the shopping list"
